# EV2023_SalesData_AUTOMATION-PROJECT
In This Project, we will Automate the task of analyzing Datasets in Excel to answer Key evaluation questions for critical planning. 
The Data is first extracted from kaggle either by web scrapping or downloading the Excel file directly to the local host machine.(there is a separate process provided for the local host section)
the project then takes you through a workflow that cleans and prepares the data set for extraction. the new Excel file contains only the required info.
the data is then Manipulated to analyze key features and answer critical business decision questions.
these are then mailed to one or several users using the SMTP Gmail servers.
